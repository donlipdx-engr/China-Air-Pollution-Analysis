# China-Air-Pollution-Analysis

## Introduction

Here, we consider a synthetic dataset of air pollution and meteorological data for five cities in China: Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, and Guangzhou. The data spans from 2015-2024. Our task is to forecast the air quality index (AQI) for each of these five cities for the year 2030. Here, we use ARIMA, ETS, and an LSTM to forecast AQI for each of the five cities in our dataset.
